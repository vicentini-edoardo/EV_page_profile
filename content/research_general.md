## What I Do

I am an experimental physicist developing advanced optical instruments to understand how materials interact with light at extremely small scales.
Under conventional observation, we see how a material reflects or absorbs light as a whole. Yet materials are composed of nanoscale structures — nanoparticles, thin films, and crystal lattices — thousands of times smaller than the width of a human hair. At these dimensions, light behaves in unexpected ways, shaping properties that determine how efficiently a solar panel operates, how sensitively a detector identifies molecules, or how fast an electronic device can function.

**My work focuses on measurement techniques capable of revealing these hidden interactions — accessing information that conventional microscopes simply cannot capture.**

## My Background

My research bridges two highly specialized traditions in optical measurement.

**Optical frequency-comb metrology**  
During my PhD at Politecnico di Milano and a research stay at the Max Planck Institute for Quantum Optics, I worked with optical frequency combs — ultra-precise laser systems that act as rulers for light. These tools enable exceptionally accurate measurements of optical frequency and provide detailed insight into material properties through their spectral signatures.

**Near-field nano-optics**  
Since 2022, at CIC nanoGUNE in San Sebastián, my work has focused on near-field techniques that overcome the diffraction limit of light, enabling observation of features far smaller than the wavelength itself. This allows direct study of optical phenomena where quantum effects and nanoscale structure dominate behavior.

Together, these domains provide complementary perspectives:

- **Precision and metrological accuracy**
- **Nanometer-scale spatial resolution**

## Pillar I — Seeing Beyond the Diffraction Limit

### The Challenge
Conventional optical microscopes cannot resolve features smaller than roughly half the wavelength of light (≈200–500 nm in the visible range). Many critical structures in modern materials — quantum dots, molecular layers, plasmonic antennas — lie well below this threshold.

### My Approach: s-SNOM

I use **scattering-type scanning near-field optical microscopy (s-SNOM)** to bypass this fundamental limit.

Imagine trying to read microscopic text that even a magnifying glass cannot resolve. Instead of relying on optics alone, you trace each letter with the tip of a needle while illuminating it — the needle becomes the true probe.

s-SNOM follows this principle:

- An ultra-sharp metallic tip (10–20 nm radius) scans the surface.
- Light concentrated at the apex forms a nanoscale optical hotspot.
- The detected scattered light reveals local optical properties with resolution defined by the tip — not the wavelength.

### What This Enables

**Imaging compressed light waves**  
Some materials confine light into volumes up to 100× smaller than its free-space wavelength. I visualize these waves — known as polaritons — tracking their propagation and energy dissipation to inform the design of optical antennas, sensors, and nanophotonic circuits.

**Chemical mapping at the nanoscale**  
Because materials exhibit unique optical fingerprints, s-SNOM allows creation of chemical maps with nanometer precision, distinguishing components within complex layered devices and biological systems.

**Observing ultrafast dynamics**  
By combining femtosecond laser pulses with near-field detection, I capture how materials respond immediately after optical excitation — revealing carrier motion, heat transport, and phase transitions within individual nanostructures.

## Pillar II — Ultra-Precise Optical Measurements

Before moving into nanoscale imaging, I developed measurement strategies based on **optical frequency combs**, a technology recognized with the 2005 Nobel Prize in Physics.

### What Is a Frequency Comb?

A frequency comb functions like a ruler for light.

Rather than emitting a single color, it produces thousands of evenly spaced spectral lines — “teeth” — stabilized to atomic clocks and therefore extraordinarily precise.

### What I Developed

**Precision spectroscopy**  
I measured absorption and emission with calibration traceable to fundamental constants, enabling molecular identification, reaction monitoring, and high-accuracy material characterization.

**Dual-comb spectroscopy**  
Using two combs with slightly different spacings, I acquired broadband spectra thousands of times faster than traditional methods — compressing minutes into microseconds.

**Three-dimensional holographic imaging**  
I developed comb-based holographic techniques capable of retrieving both intensity and phase, allowing volumetric reconstruction across hundreds of wavelengths without mechanical scanning.

## Why This Matters

Modern technologies — microelectronics, photovoltaics, LEDs, sensors, and quantum devices — increasingly rely on nanoscale physics.

Understanding light–matter interaction at these dimensions is essential for:

- Designing more efficient energy materials  
- Enabling faster optical communications  
- Creating highly sensitive diagnostic sensors  
- Advancing quantum technologies  

### For Fundamental Science

At the nanoscale, classical intuition gives way to quantum behavior and collective excitations. The measurement platforms I develop help test theoretical predictions and uncover new physical phenomena.

### For Reproducible Research

A central objective of my work is building instruments that deliver **quantitative and reproducible data**, not merely compelling images — enabling reliable comparison across laboratories and accelerating translation from discovery to application.

## The Philosophy Behind My Work

Across all projects, my guiding principle is simple:

> **Measurement tools should provide calibrated answers — not qualitative impressions.**

Scientific progress depends on quantification: understanding not only that something changes, but by how much, and why.
This requires rigorous instrument design, careful calibration, and a strong connection between experiment and electrodynamic theory.

Ultimately, my research is about building bridges:

- between measurement techniques  
- between theory and experiment  
- between laboratory discoveries and technological impact
