I build advanced optical instruments to study how light interacts with materials at very small scales and very short times. My training spans frequency-comb metrology (PhD in Milan and work at MPQ) and near-field microscopy (nanoGUNE since 2022).

**Pillar — s-SNOM**

s-SNOM concentrates light with a sharp probe to observe optical behavior far below conventional microscope resolution.

- **IR–THz nanoimaging** — Visualizes surface waves and their propagation at the nanoscale.
- **Nanospectroscopy** — Connects chemical composition with local optical response.
- **Ultrafast nanospectroscopy** — Tracks how materials respond immediately after excitation.

**Pillar — Optical frequency combs**

Optical frequency combs are specialized lasers that produce perfectly ordered colors of light, enabling extremely accurate optical measurements.

- **Frequency metrology** — Acts as a precise ruler for light across broad bandwidths.
- **Dual-comb spectroscopy** — Captures detailed spectra quickly without moving parts.
- **Dual-comb holography** — Combines precise spectroscopy with three-dimensional imaging.
