## Reserch path {#questions}

Experimental physicist developing measurement platforms for quantitative surface light–matter interaction.

My background bridges two experimental worlds: optical frequency-comb metrology, developed during my PhD at Politecnico di Milano and expanded through a research stay at the Max Planck Institute for Quantum Optics; and near-field nano-optics, matured since 2022 at CIC nanoGUNE, where I develop s-SNOM-based methodologies. I use this combination of experiencies to access observables that standard optics cannot provide and to connect  measurements with fundamental physical models.

## Pillar — s-SNOM {#pillar-snom}

![s-SNOM near-field imaging](assets/img/research-pillars/SNOM_cover.png)

s-SNOM is a near-field optical technique that circumvents the diffraction limit by localizing electromagnetic fields at the apex of a metallic atomic force microscope tip. It enables imaging and spectroscopy with spatial resolution determined by the tip apex radius rather than the wavelength of light. Since joining nanoGUNE in 2022, I have developed approaches that link real-space near-field signals to electrodynamic models and quantitative parameters.

- **IR–THz nanoimaging** — Reveals phonon and plasmon polaritons with wavelengths far below free-space radiation, enabling direct analysis of confinement, anisotropy, and dissipation.
- **Nanospectroscopy** — Correlates chemical composition, electronic structure, and local optical response within nanometric volumes, enabling quantitative comparison with theory.
- **Ultrafast nanospectroscopy** — Combines femtosecond pump–probe excitation with near-field detection to access non-equilibrium dynamics with spatial and temporal resolution.

## Pillar — Optical frequency combs {#pillar-ofc}

![Optical frequency combs](assets/img/research-pillars/comb_cover.png)

Optical frequency combs are laser sources whose spectra consist of evenly spaced, phase-coherent lines that function as rulers in frequency space. They connect optical measurements to primary standards and enable traceable, reproducible spectroscopy. My work with frequency combs began during my PhD at Politecnico di Milano and expanded at the Max Planck Institute for Quantum Optics, including dual-comb methods for spectroscopy and holography.

- **Frequency metrology** — Provides absolute calibration of optical freqeuncies across broad bandwidths, ensuring highly precise and highly accurate spectrscopy.
- **Dual-comb spectroscopy** — Replaces mechanical scanning with optical sampling, enabling rapid broadband acquisition with high spectral resolution.
- **Dual-comb holography** — Extends metrological precision to coherent imaging, enabling scan-free wavefront reconstruction and hyperspectral three-dimensional measurements.
