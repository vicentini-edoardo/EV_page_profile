## Overview {#questions}

**Overview.** I am an experimental physicist with expertise spanning two complementary fields: optical frequency-comb metrology and scattering-type scanning near-field optical microscopy (s-SNOM).

**Background.** My background bridges these two experimental worlds. I developed frequency-comb techniques during my PhD at Politecnico di Milano and through a research stay at the Max Planck Institute for Quantum Optics, focusing on precision spectroscopy and coherent imaging. Since 2022, at CIC nanoGUNE, I have shifted focus to near-field nano-optics, developing s-SNOM-based methodologies to probe nanoscale optical phenomena with spectroscopic detail.

**Perspective.** This dual expertise provides me with a broad experimental toolkit and complementary perspectives: metrological precision from frequency combs and nanoscale spatial resolution from near-field techniques. Together, they enable me to approach surface light–matter interaction from multiple angles, connecting measurements to fundamental physical models across different length and frequency scales.


## Pillar — s-SNOM {#pillar-snom}

**What it enables.** My current work at CIC nanoGUNE centers on developing quantitative near-field optical measurements using scattering-type scanning near-field optical microscopy. s-SNOM circumvents the diffraction limit by localizing electromagnetic fields at the apex of a sharp metallic AFM tip (~10–20 nm radius). This enables optical imaging and spectroscopy with spatial resolution determined by tip geometry rather than wavelength—revealing nanoscale phenomena invisible to conventional optics.

**Why it matters.** I develop experimental approaches that transform near-field signals into quantitative observables: propagation lengths, quality factors, local conductivities, and material-specific optical constants. My goal is to establish robust methodologies that connect real-space measurements with electrodynamic models and enable reproducible, model-independent parameter extraction.

**Highlights.**
- **IR–THz nanoimaging** — Reveals phonon-polaritons and plasmons in van der Waals materials and nanostructures with wavelengths compressed far below free-space radiation (λ/10 to λ/100). Enables direct measurement of confinement, anisotropic dispersion, and dissipation with nanometric precision across the 1–30 THz range.
- **Nanospectroscopy** — Maps local dielectric response, chemical composition, and electronic structure within nanometric volumes. Correlates near-field spectra with theoretical predictions and analytical models, enabling material identification and quantitative extraction of optical constants at surfaces and interfaces.
- **Ultrafast nanospectroscopy** — Combines femtosecond pump–probe excitation with near-field detection to resolve non-equilibrium carrier dynamics, phonon relaxation, and transient phase transitions. Provides simultaneous spatial (~20 nm) and temporal (~10 fs) resolution—accessing ultrafast phenomena in single nanostructures and heterogeneous materials.


## Pillar — Optical frequency combs {#pillar-ofc}

**What it enables.** During my PhD and postdoctoral work, I developed expertise in optical frequency-comb techniques for precision spectroscopy and coherent imaging. Optical frequency combs are laser sources whose output consists of evenly spaced, phase-coherent spectral lines—forming a precise “ruler” in frequency space. They connect optical measurements to atomic standards and enable traceable, reproducible spectroscopy with unprecedented accuracy.

**Work context.** I worked on dual-comb methods at Politecnico di Milano and the Max Planck Institute for Quantum Optics, developing applications in broadband spectroscopy and phase-sensitive imaging.

**Highlights.**
- **Frequency metrology** — Absolute calibration of optical frequencies across octave-spanning bandwidths with Hz-level precision. Enables highly accurate spectroscopy without external wavelength references—establishing traceable links between optical measurements and fundamental constants.
- **Dual-comb spectroscopy** — Replaces mechanical scanning with optical sampling using two combs with slightly different repetition rates. Enables rapid acquisition of broadband spectra (THz to visible) with MHz-level resolution and microsecond acquisition times—orders of magnitude faster than Fourier-transform methods.
- **Dual-comb holography** — Extends metrological precision to coherent imaging by interfering comb sources. Enables scan-free, phase-sensitive wavefront reconstruction and hyperspectral three-dimensional measurements—capturing both amplitude and phase information across hundreds of spectral channels simultaneously.


## Research Perspective

**Progression.** My research path reflects a progression from metrological precision at macroscopic scales to quantitative measurements at the nanoscale.

**Methodology.** Frequency-comb techniques taught me the value of absolute calibration, phase-coherent detection, and model-independent parameter extraction. Near-field methods now allow me to apply similar principles of quantitative measurement to phenomena that occur at surfaces, interfaces, and within individual nanostructures.

**Philosophy.** While these two areas represent distinct experimental platforms, they share a common philosophy: developing measurement methodologies that provide not just qualitative images or spectra, but calibrated, reproducible observables that can be directly compared with theory and validated across laboratories.
