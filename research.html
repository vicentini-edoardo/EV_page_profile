          <div class="view-scientific">
            <p>Experimental physicist developing next-generation nano-optical measurement platforms for quantitative light–matter interaction.</p>
            <p>My research is motivated by a simple premise: major advances in nanophotonics require not only new materials, but fundamentally new ways to measure them.</p>
            <p>I design experimental architectures that merge nanoscale spatial resolution, ultrafast temporal access, and metrological spectral precision, enabling direct observation of physical processes that remain inaccessible to conventional optical techniques.</p>
            <p>My scientific trajectory combines two complementary experimental cultures:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Optical frequency-comb metrology, developed during my doctoral work at the Politecnico di Milano and expanded through research at the Max Planck Institute for Quantum Optics.</li>
              <li>Near-field nano-optics, matured since 2022 at CIC nanoGUNE, where I develop s-SNOM-based methodologies to extract quantitative observables from real-space measurements.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Together, these directions support a broad point of view on surface light–matter interaction, in which instrumentation is conceived not merely as a technical tool, but as a path toward predictive electrodynamics at the nanoscale.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="view-general">
            <p>I build advanced optical instruments that allow us to observe how light interacts with materials at extremely small scales and over extremely short times. These tools help reveal processes that are normally invisible and support the development of future photonic technologies.</p>

          <h2>Intellectual Positioning</h2>
          <div class="view-scientific">
            <p>When a physical phenomenon cannot be measured directly, the priority is to build the instrument that makes it observable.</p>
            <p>My research operates at the interface between measurement science and nanophotonics, with the long-term objective of transforming nano-optics from a largely descriptive discipline into a quantitative and predictive framework.</p>

          <h2>Pillar I — s-SNOM</h2>
          <div class="view-scientific">
<p>s-SNOM is a near-field optical technique that circumvents the diffraction limit by localizing electromagnetic fields at the apex of a nanometric probe. It enables imaging and spectroscopy with spatial resolution determined by the probe rather than the wavelength of light.</p>
            <h3>Vision</h3>
            <p>To establish near-field nano-optics as a quantitative experimental science, capable of directly measuring the parameters that govern light–matter interaction at deeply subwavelength scales.</p>
            <h3>Why this matters</h3>
            <p>Many emergent properties of quantum and nanostructured materials originate on length scales far below the diffraction limit. s-SNOM enables these measurements. My work focuses on pushing the technique beyond imaging toward parameter extraction — including dispersion, damping, coupling strength, and transient response.</p>
            <h3>Trajectory</h3>
            <p>Since joining nanoGUNE in 2022, I have developed near-field approaches aimed at linking real-space observables with electrodynamic models.</p>

              <h4>IR–THz Nanoimaging</h4>
              <p>Infrared and terahertz nanoimaging reveals phonon and plasmon polaritons whose wavelengths can be orders of magnitude smaller than free-space radiation. Mapping their propagation provides direct insight into confinement, anisotropy, and dissipation at material interfaces.</p>

<p>s-SNOM is an advanced microscopy technique that concentrates light into extremely small regions using a sharp probe, allowing scientists to observe optical behavior far below the resolution of conventional microscopes.</p>
            <h3>What it is</h3>
            <p>Near-field microscopy uses a nanoscale probe to concentrate light into regions much smaller than its wavelength, allowing us to see optical behavior at the scale where many material properties originate.</p>
            <h3>Why it matters</h3>
            <p>Modern materials often behave differently at the nanoscale. Understanding these local responses is essential for designing faster electronics, improved sensors, and next-generation optical devices.</p>
            <div class="subsection">
              <h4>IR–THz Nanoimaging</h4>
              <p>This technique lets us visualize how electromagnetic waves travel along a material surface, like watching ripples move across water but at a scale thousands of times smaller than a human hair.</p>
              <p class="emphasis">Impact: Seeing these waves directly helps design materials that guide light more efficiently.</p>

              <h4>Ultrafast Nanospectroscopy</h4>
              <p>By combining ultrafast laser pulses with near-field microscopy, we can observe how materials respond immediately after being excited — essentially filming processes that occur in trillionths of a second.</p>
